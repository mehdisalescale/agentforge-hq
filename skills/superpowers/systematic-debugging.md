# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## The Four Phases

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully** — Don't skip past errors. Read stack traces completely. Note line numbers, file paths, error codes.
2. **Reproduce Consistently** — Can you trigger it reliably? What are the exact steps?
3. **Check Recent Changes** — Git diff, recent commits, new dependencies, config changes, environmental differences.
4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems** — Add diagnostic instrumentation at each component boundary. Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks.
5. **Trace Data Flow** — Where does bad value originate? Keep tracing up until you find the source. Fix at source, not at symptom.

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

1. **Find Working Examples** — Locate similar working code in same codebase
2. **Compare Against References** — Read reference implementations COMPLETELY
3. **Identify Differences** — List every difference, however small
4. **Understand Dependencies** — What other components, settings, config does this need?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

1. **Form Single Hypothesis** — State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
2. **Test Minimally** — Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
3. **Verify Before Continuing** — Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis. DON'T add more fixes on top.

### Phase 4: Implementation

1. **Create Failing Test Case** — Simplest possible reproduction
2. **Implement Single Fix** — Address the root cause. ONE change at a time.
3. **Verify Fix** — Test passes? No regressions?
4. **If 3+ Fixes Failed** — STOP and question the architecture. Discuss with team before attempting more fixes.

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than thrashing |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| 1. Root Cause | Read errors, reproduce, check changes | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| 2. Pattern | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| 3. Hypothesis | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| 4. Implementation | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |
